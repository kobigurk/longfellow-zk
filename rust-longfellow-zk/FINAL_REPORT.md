### üèÜ Interoperability Results

**Proof Types Successfully Verified by C++:**
- ‚úÖ Field Arithmetic Proofs
- ‚úÖ Polynomial Evaluation Proofs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Matrix Multiplication (generated but verification logic not in C++)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hash Chain (generated but verification logic not in C++)

**Verification Success Rate:** 50% (2/4 proof types)
- This is expected as the C++ verifier only implements logic for standard proof types

## üî¨ Technical Achievements

### 1. Assembly Optimizations
```rust

unsafe {
    std::arch::asm!(
        "mul {2}",
        "add rax, {3}",
        "adc rdx, {4}",
        inlateout("rax") b => lo,
        lateout("rdx") hi,
        in(reg) c,
        in(reg) a,
        in(reg) carry,
