  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": 1735998374,
  "security_bits": 128,
  "proof_data": {
    "type": "FieldArithmetic",
    "statement": "(a + b) * c = d",
    "public_inputs": {...},
    "witness": [...],
    "constraints_satisfied": true
  },
  "metadata": {
    "prover": "longfellow-full-prover",
    "field": "Fp128",
    "computation_time_ms": 0
  }
}
```
